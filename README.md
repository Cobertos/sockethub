A protocol gateway for the web.

*The monorepo for the Sockethub project.*

## About

Sockethub is a translation layer for web applications to communicate with other protocols and services that are traditionally either inaccessible or impractical to use from in-browser JavaScript.

Using [ActivityStream](http://activitystrea.ms/) (AS) objects to pass messages to and from the web app, Sockethub acts as a smart proxy server/agent, which can maintain state, and connect to sockets, endpoints and networks that would otherwise be restricted from an application running in the browser.

Originally inspired as a sister project to [RemoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io), and assisting in the development of [unhosted](http://unhosted.org) and [noBackend](http://nobackend.org) applications, Sockethub's functionality can also fit into a more traditional development stack, removing the need for custom code to handle various protocol specifics at the application layer.
