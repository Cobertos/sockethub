# Sockethub architecture overview

Sockethub is an abstraction layer on top of the many different protocols of the web. Although the project is still young and only a small portion of the planned APIs are supported (the logic of which is contained in what are known as *platforms*), the goal is to continue to improve platform coverage over time.

# Platform support

For starters, the focus is on messaging. Protocols that we'd like to implement in this area are: XMPP, Email (POP, IMAP, SMTP), Facebook, Twitter. We encourage developers to help us build out these platforms (and feel free to contribute other platforms outside of this scope).
